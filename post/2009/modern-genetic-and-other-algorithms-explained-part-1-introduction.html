	    <p>A few days ago I saw <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7n1zl/genetic_algorithms_cool_name_amp_damn_simple_best/">this on reddit</a>, linking to a <a href="http://lethain.com/entry/2009/jan/02/genetic-algorithms-cool-name-damn-simple/">well-written article</a> about genetic algorithms (<span class="caps">GA</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genetic algorithms are a mysterious sounding technique in mysterious sounding field&#8212;artificial intelligence. This is the problem with naming things appropriately. When the field was labeled artificial intelligence, it meant using mathematics to artificially create the semblance of intelligence, but self-engrandizing researchers and Isaac Asimov redefined it as robots.
The name genetic algorithms does sound complex and has a faintly magical ring to it, but it turns out that they are one of the simplest and most-intuitive concepts you&#8217;ll encounter in <span class="caps">A.I.
</span>If you&#8217;re interested in <span class="caps">GA</span>&#8217;s or modern optimization techniques in general, I strongly suggest you read it. The sample code in Python is fairly easy to read, even if you&#8217;ve never programmed in Python. On the reddit comment section, the following discussion was then started:
The nice thing about GAs is that they are so simple. [&#8230;] As soon as you step out of the specialized <span class="caps">GA</span> literature and into other fields where the authors just happen to choose a <span class="caps">GA</span> for their problem, it&#8217;s more likely than not that they&#8217;ve chosen a poor implementation.
The problems that simple GAs work pretty well on tend to be the same as those that a simple hill climber would demolish the <span class="caps">GA</span> on. As soon as the problems get hard, the <span class="caps">GA</span> converges way too quickly to suboptimal solutions. [&#8230;]
Part of the problem is the <span class="caps">GA</span> community itself. For years, GAs were touted as &#8220;global optimizers&#8221;. We haven&#8217;t talked like that for several years now, but I still see references to people who seem to think that solving a problem is as simple as just throwing a <span class="caps">GA</span> at&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by a&nbsp;response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in the look-ma-no-hands-period of <span class="caps">AI</span>, GAs converged too rapidly because they weren&#8217;t tuned right: they used too much selection, too little mutation or other exploration mechanisms, too small of a population, etc. Since the field was unified with other evolutionary computation techniques in the early &#8216;90s, I don&#8217;t think premature convergence has been a major impediment for almost 20 years now. Evolutionary computation techniques are pretty much the best available methods for much of stochastic search (and yes, I&#8217;m looking at you, simulated annealing). They&#8217;re highly parallelizable, have good theory, and are representation-independent. Recent versions of them (notably ant colony optimization) are the gold standard for certain major tasks (like stochastic combinatorics problems).
As to tabu search: now there is a technique which has some real pathologies. Perhaps this wasn&#8217;t the best example you could have&nbsp;chosen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting&#8230; I recommend reading the full discussion at the reddit&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve always been interested in genetic and other modern optimization techniques, I wanted to a little research. In this series of posts, I will try to&nbsp;explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetic&nbsp;Algorithms</li>
<li>A more specialized <span class="caps">GA</span>: <span class="caps">CHC</span>. Eshelman&#8217;s algorithms, as mentioned in the reddit&nbsp;comments.</li>
<li>Simulated&nbsp;Annealing</li>
<li>Ant Colony&nbsp;Optimization</li>
<li>And: a comparison with Tabu&nbsp;search</li>
</ul>
<p>I will mention pseudocode in each of the posts, and will also edit the original Python to use it with the other&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>First a disclaimer though: I&#8217;m not an expert, I&#8217;m not a specialized <span class="caps">GA</span>-programmer, neither a mathematician. Also: I&#8217;m fairly new at Python, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to toy around with some code, so please excuse my possibly poor programming. Still, that being said, I try my best to provide valid information and real&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>In <a href="////blog.macuyiko.com/post/2009/modern-genetic-and-other-algorithms-explained-part-2-genetic-algorithms.html">part 2</a> I will discuss (general) Genetic&nbsp;Algorithms.</p>
