		</header>
	
	    <p>There are two things I currently not like about Ubuntu or Linux in general: the whole sound mess, and the whole graphics mess (but both are getting better). This problem is about the first&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>Skype was working perfectly in Interprid, now in Jaunty it was telling me that there was a &#8220;Problem with audio capture&#8221;. I tested Ubuntu&#8217;s sound-recorder as well, which was not working&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using the default, normal Skype from the Medibuntu&nbsp;repo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at all the different factors here. First of all, open <code>System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sound</code>. Mine looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound Events - Sound playback:&nbsp;Autodetect</li>
<li>Music and Movies - Sound playback:&nbsp;Autodetect</li>
<li>Audio Conferencing<ul>
<li>Sound playback:&nbsp;Autodetect</li>
<li><strong>Sound capture</strong>: <span class="caps">ALSA</span> - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, in your case, this may say PulseAudio Sound Server here. However, I have noticed that <span class="caps">ALSA</span> seems to record better sound (less garbled, especially with slower computers). Since we&#8217;re not doing anything unusual with recorded sound (client-server, multiple inputs), I suggest you also pick <span class="caps">ALSA</span>&nbsp;here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now right click the sound icon in the panel and pick &#8220;Open Volume Control&#8221;. My device says &#8220;<span class="caps">HDA</span> Intel (Alsa mixer)&#8221;. You&#8217;ll probably need the Alsa mixer as well. I have a few sliders I have to play&nbsp;with:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Playback-tab (yes, here!): Mic&nbsp;Boost</li>
<li>In the Recording-tab:&nbsp;Capture</li>
<li>In the Switches-tab: make sure Microphone Capture is enabled! This was disabled after my Jaunty upgrade. If you&#8217;re not seeing any relevant sliders or checkboxes, click the Preferences-button and enable all relevant&nbsp;sliders/switches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now open sound-recorder. You should be able to record sound now. Also, start <code>pavucontrol</code>, and click the Input Devices-tab, the level meter should respond to you clapping your hands for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Hear yourself? No, then try fiddling again with the settings in the previously opened windows before you&nbsp;continue!</p>
<p>Yes, good, onwards to Skype. Try making a test call. In my case, Skype was still complaining about the audio capture. Let&#8217;s open Skype&#8217;s options -&gt; Sound&nbsp;Devices.</p>
<p>In my case, the options&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound In: <span class="caps">HDA</span> Intel&nbsp;(hw:Intel,0)</li>
<li>Sound Out:&nbsp;pulse</li>
<li>Ringing:&nbsp;pulse</li>
</ul>
<p>Which was working in Intrepid. If you suffer the same problem, read&nbsp;on&#8230;</p>
<p>A sidenote, your Sound In device might be either pulse or default as well. There are a few cases when you should use&nbsp;these:</p>
<ul>
<li>default: if you&#8217;ve succesfully changed configuration files to make the correct devices the default ones. This will almost never be the&nbsp;case.</li>
<li>pulse: if you&#8217;re using PulseAudio server for the Sound Capture. But even then, I don&#8217;t recommend it. Using pulse for Sound In often crashes Skype on my&nbsp;machine&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, provided when you use a normal Skype (non static, non <span class="caps">OSS</span>).</p>
<p>Your Sound Out/Ringing devices are already correct, they need to be pulse. Sound In will be set to an&nbsp;hw-device.</p>
<p>Before reading further, try making a test call with every listed hw-device (I had four, you can have more or&nbsp;less).</p>
<p>If none of them are working or if you&#8217;re sure which hw-device you need (and it isn&#8217;t working), try this: edit <code>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</code> (don&#8217;t forget to sudo) and make sure the following lines are present and uncommented, with the following&nbsp;values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>default-fragments = 8
default-fragment-size-msec = 5
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is an optional step however, but it seems to help with the Skype sound quality (an other option is setting <code>default-fragment-size-msec</code> to&nbsp;10).</p>
<p><strong>(!)</strong> Now,  edit <code>~/.asoundrc</code> (no need to be root here, it&#8217;s a file in your home directory). And make sure the following lines are&nbsp;there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nx">pcm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pulse</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">pulse</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">ctl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pulse</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">pulse</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which I totally did in Hardy as well! The update must&#8217;ve deleted them. This simple file seemed to do the&nbsp;trick!</p>
<p>Then, just to be sure, I reinstalled  the <code>libasound2-plugins</code> package.</p>
<p>Reboot, or restart pulseaudio (kill it, then start it in i.e. a Terminal window). Restart Skype. Skype was working fine now. If it is not, make sure you try every&nbsp;plughw-device.</p>
<p>Still not working, no matter how much you try? You&#8217;re out of luck. If sound-recorder and sound playback is working, you can try an emergency solution. Install the static, <span class="caps">OSS</span> version of Skype (you can find it with Medibuntu or floating around in a tarball somewhere). and start it&nbsp;with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>padsp skype
</code></pre></div>

<p>To route the sounds through the PulseAudio sink. Sound devices in this Skype should all be set to default (or <span class="caps">OSS</span>). Calls should work now. Be warned though: always try this as a last resort, routing <span class="caps">OSS</span> sound through PulseAudio is slow and bloated, ugly and old. Your record voice will sound like&#8230; well,&nbsp;crap.</p>
