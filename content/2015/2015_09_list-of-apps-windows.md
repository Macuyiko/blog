Again that time of the year where Windows's being reinstalled, so [once again](|filename|/2014/2014_11_list-of-apps-windows.md) I'm jotting down a list of apps I normally install right away, slightly updated versus last year.

(This list last updated in May 2016.)

## Web ##

- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) is back. The web version was not robust enough.
- [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). Don't forget the Chrome Remote Desktop extension.
- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/)
- [Google Drive](http://www.google.com/drive), though I've been using [InSync](https://www.insynchq.com/) lately as it works better if you have many files/folders.
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)
- [qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/) as a replacement for Tixati, which I was using before (and Miniget before that).

## General ##

- Microsoft Office
- [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) makes the Windows command line ten times better. Comes with Clink. Replaces Putty as ssh is included.
- [Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/) to locate files and folders by name instantly.
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)
- [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
- [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/)
- Fonts: Open Sans especially.

## Data Science ##

- [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
- [Disco](http://fluxicon.com/disco/)
- [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
- [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)

## Coding and Editing ##

- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/)
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Don't forget to install Package Manager with SFTP.
- [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). New on the list, could not do without anymore for larger projects.
