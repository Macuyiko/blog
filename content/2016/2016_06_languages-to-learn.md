Title: Programming Languages to Try

I routinely use Python, R and Java during my day-to-day tasks, but have been itching recently to get up to speed or try out some of the following languages.

This list basically serves as a note to myself to start experimenting with some of them:

- [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) -- basically in combination with OpenFL and Flixel to try my hand at recreational Android game programming.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) -- hearing great things about Rust lately.
- [Go](https://golang.org/) -- one of the favorites these days, were it not for the lack of generics.
- [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/) -- not sure how this stacks up to Go and Rust, but it looks to be an interesting project as well.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) -- as someone who's been scarred by Java for a long time, Kotlin seems like the absolutely best way towards improving upon the language. Looks really fun!
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) -- looks like a very solid Lisp/Scheme dialect, with an awesome programming environment and community. I especially like how people have been using the language in the typesetting ecosphere.
- [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) -- not really "new", as I've been using Scala before (together with Spark), but I definitely need to grok it more.
- Erlang and [Elexir](http://elixir-lang.org/) -- which look like being an incredible robust solution towards building server apps.
- [Io](http://iolanguage.org/) -- more as a research exercise.
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) -- in a similar realm as Haxe, to use in combination with the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework, though I always find the language to be messy to work with once projects get large.
- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) -- a Ruby-like language with strict syntax and checking.
- [Julia](http://julialang.org/) -- as a potential R replacement, though the ecosystem is still quite far behind.
