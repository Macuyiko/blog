I finally found some time to spend some time on the sequel of what was a fantastic game: Neverwinter Nights...  
People who played the first game will not feel right at home immediatly, lucky there's a friendly tutorial to make you feel at home. The story is nice so far (I only played a few hours). The graphics are nice too, but I don't understand why the system requirements are so high, the game isn't _that _advanced, so I'm forced to play at 1024x768.  
In short:  \+ Plot.  \+ Many classes.  \+ Many side-quests.  \+ Interesting companions.  \+ Toolset!  \+ Great multiplayer opportunities.  \+ Sound and music.  \+ Graphics are nice (especially spells).  \- Other graphics are less nice.  \- Also: high system requirements.  \- Interface could be better.  \- AI is sometimes stupid.  \- Camera could be better.
