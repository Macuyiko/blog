I've been checking out some games for my Linux machine recently (that almost sounds like an oxymoron). I'm not going to go all whiny on you with a "Linux does have games!"-post, but will just review a few of them (the most popular ones).  
- [Planet Penguin Racer](http://projects.planetpenguin.de/racer/) (a fork of Tux Racer): I never wanted this game, when all those Linux-sites/posts/magazines said: "hey look we have a racing game with a penguin" it just looked too kidish. However: it is quite entertainable, and making some maps is quite fun. This is a nice quickie-game for the people with direct 3d rendering enabled ;).- [Neverball](http://www.icculus.org/neverball/): a game where you tilt the play field to make a ball roll and pick up coins. It's fun and looks quite nice but I suck at it.- Freecraft: it's an RTS, with poor graphics (sorry), I didn't like it that much and wish there was a good RTS game for Linux. I don't have anything against sprites (I loved Age of Empires 1 and 2, Age of Wonders, Starcraft, Kohan, etc...), but this can look better.  - [Globulation 2](http://globulation2.org/wiki/Main_Page): also an RTS. Also not bad but I don't like it that much.- [Tuxkart](http://tuxkart.sourceforge.net/): fun for a while but not fantastic.- [Frozen Bubble](http://www.frozen-bubble.org/): the game everyone knows, and still great fun too!- [Pingus](http://pingus.seul.org/welcome.html): a Lemmings clone. Well done game, will keep the oldskool puzzlers really entertained!- [Rocks And Diamonds](http://www.artsoft.org/rocksndiamonds/): an all-in-one Boulderdash clone. Which I absolutely love because I can even play the Supaplex levels.- [Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org/): another instant-classic, hexgrid fantasy strategy game, well done graphics and great tactical fun both online and offline.- [Crimson Fields](http://crimson.seul.org/index2.php): Battle Isle clone, not bad but the graphics aren't that great.- [Advanced Strategic Command](http://www.asc-hq.org/): also a Battle Isle clone: better (traditional) graphics and AI, but the interface/polishing could be better.- [SCUMMVM](http://www.scummvm.org/): absolute favorite. Grab this program together with some fat old-Lucasarts-adventures torrents and relive all those classics... A fantastic game for those long train-trips. Ah... the memories of playing Broken Sword 2 and really diggin' the characters and story. They don't make such games anymore since Grim Fandago [1].
That's it. It's not F.E.A.R., no Civilization 4, no GTA and no Age of Empires 3, but it is enough to kill a few minutes. After all, my Linux computer is my work machine, so the less I play, the more work I get done...  
[1]: Actually I'm lying: Dreamfall, Fahrenheit (a.k.a. Indigo Prophecy) and others are great recent adventure games.
