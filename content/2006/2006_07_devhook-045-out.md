Read all about it [here](http://www.qj.net/Devhook-updated-to-v0-45-Launching-Homebrew-on-Emulated-2-71-Now-Possible-/pg/49/aid/59338) (watch out though, the site [is getting Dugg](http://digg.com/gaming_news/Devhook_now_allows_you_to_launch_homebrew_on_the_latest_PSP_firmware%21)).  
Guide on how to do it can be found [here](http://forums.qj.net/showthread.php?p=818678). This is great news, Devhook is the reward we 1.50 users get for being patient such a long time. (A shame for the people who bought a 2.50+ PSP...)
