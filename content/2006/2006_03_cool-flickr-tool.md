Always a perfect way to start a blog: write about some little handy tools, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.Previously featured on Digg and Slashdot, and now happily living in my taskbar: [John's Background Switcher](http://www.johnsadventures.com/backend/BackgroundSwitcher/). Basically, it just replaces your desktop background every x hours. (But wait, there's more.)  
This tool can operate in three modes:  1. Select a set of pictures to rotate. (Yawn.)  2. Select a whole folder.  3. Now comes the neat part: use Flickr to randomly download a picture! (You can even specify a tag to search for!) If you don't like the picture returned, just double click the icon.  
Really handy stuff! I've seen some nice and beautiful pictures already. It's a pity that you can't specify more options though (popularity, size, category), but oh well...  
Actually, this little tool has made me think about a piece of code I could write.
