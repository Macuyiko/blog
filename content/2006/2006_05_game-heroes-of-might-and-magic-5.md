I must admit that I never played any other game from the HHOMM series before. (Except maybe number two or three at a friends house for a few hours). But I have played another game from the same developer: Etherlords 2, which I liked quite a lot. (Well: I liked the duels.)  
HHOMM 5 looked like much more of the same, but in fact it is a nice game. Especially recommended if you're a fan of turn-based strategy, tactics and previous HHOMM games.  
So again: a quick rundown:  
**Pros:**
  - Nice graphics (you need a fairly strong rig to run it).
  - Nice gameplay.
  - Variety in the units.
  - Strategic battles.
  - Can be very difficult.
  - Not your average RTS game. 
**Cons:**  
  - Not your average RTS game.
  - Can be very difficult.
  - May get boring after a while.
  - You might not like the genre.
P.S.: Remember GTA SA MP? It is not very good. Lags like hell. Check out the video's at MTA. Will be much better in my humble opinion.
