It seems to spread all over the web... so I'm not going to cover the whole story here. If you do not yet know what is going on and want the bones of the tale, check out [this article](http://wiredfire.org/index.php?q=node/63).  
I suppose this state of affairs will not last forever: a few weeks, maybe a month and they'll be back. It will not be another Suprnova or - even worse - Lokitorrent. Or so I (and Diggnation too) hope.  
Edit: their site now states: SITE DOWN - WILL BE UP AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL WITHIN A DAY OR TWO...
