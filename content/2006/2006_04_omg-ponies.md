It's the first of April and the Internet surely has noticed it.  
A few of the greatest jokes today:  
<http://slashdot.org/articles/06/03/31/1644225.shtml>: slashdot changes design for wider appeal. From now on, all article titles must contain "OMG", "!!!" and caps.  
It went well until [this article](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/03/31/1746234.shtml) came along ;).  
For the ones feeling lucky today: try out [Google's new service](http://www.google.com/romance/) (their [blogpost](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/cupids-algorithms.html)), be sure to take the tour! Also, this is hilarious:  
> Profile Upload Rejected  > [...]  > ...ha ha, wasn't that amusing and harmless and mostly in good taste and not  > all psychologically damaging under various and sundry aspects of contemporary  tort law, please don't sue us; and/or  > [...]
Priceless!

Wikipedia also has a comprehensive list about [April 1st](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_1,_2006).  
Of course, one can go on and on. Check out [Matt Cutts' post](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/april-fools-watch/) about April Fools.
