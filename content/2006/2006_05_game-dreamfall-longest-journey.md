I've finished Dreamfall yesterday (after a long-night-session). It was great.  
I am not going to give any spoilers, but if you like science-fiction, fantasy, adventure games, or even movies (since you will feel you are playing a movie) you should pick up this game and play it until you see the (fantastic) ending.  
The graphics are great too. Be warned though that you need a fairly recent PC to be able to play it. Various users have reported graphical glitches. I haven't had any problems with it however (running in 1600x1200 in full AA and quality).  
The music is amazing too. There might be a soundtrack out soon, but until then I've been ripping the 300Mb worth of MP3 music out of the PAK files (use Dragon Unpacker 5 with Hyperripper).  
I have provided a mirror for [Zoe's ringtone](http://www.student.kuleuven.be/%7Es0172696/other/Ringtone.wav). (The last 4 hex values were added: the ringtone will loop and play correctly.)  
If you want a full, better-written review, check out **[Greg Kasavin's article](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/review.html?sid=6147844&print=1).  
As you can notice, I've added a small video advertisement on the right, there even is a [Spread Dreamfall website](http://spreaddreamfall.ducaet.be/), you should help them sell 500000 copies!  
Pros:  
  - Amazing story, you will play this from beginning to end with awe.
  - Beautiful setting and graphics. You will want to live in Casablanca of the future.
  - Music is fantastic (some of it by the group Magnet). I've spend the whole afternoon extracting it from the game, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack.
  - Finally: another good adventure game.
Cons:  
  - You may experience graphical glitches.
  - You need a lot of space on your main partition if you're running Windows x64, this is a known bug and will probably be patched.
  - It's not an action game, it may not be your thing.
  - A tad short, alas.
  - A lot of questions remain unanswered, so we will have to wait until the third (and probably final) part comes out... the waiting will be hard.
