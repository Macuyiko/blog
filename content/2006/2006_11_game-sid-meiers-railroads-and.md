I picked up two games recently: Sid Meier's Railroads and Trackmania Sunrise Extreme edition too. Trackmania is a nice game but quickly gets boring in my opinion: you have to play the tracks over and over again to unlock new ones. Multiplayer and the editor are fun, though.  
I'm still going to get Need For Speed: Carbon though and see how that turns out...  
Also: I've been spending a lot of time with Sid Meier's Railroads lately. The game itself is simple to learn but - typically Sid - hard to master. You build railroads and stations and connect cities and industries, then you buy trains and let them travel between them. Seems simple, but you have to watch out for your rivals, finances and economy. You buy patents and better trains over time. This is another great Sid Meier game. Nothing special, but it will keep you entertained until the late hours of the night if it's your kind of game.
