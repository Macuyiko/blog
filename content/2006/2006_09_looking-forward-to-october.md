I'm really looking forward to the end of October. Since I will then be able to update my Dapper laptop to Edgy Eft which will have AIGLX built in. Then I can install [Beryl](http://forum.beryl-project.org/) (a compiz-quinnstorm fork). I will not install beta software however, since I use that laptop for work etc... So the "how I did it"-guide will have to wait.  
If you can't wait however, [this LiveCD](http://www.sabayonlinux.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1410) could help. (Boot with "sabayon aiglx".)
From the [announcement](http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-4562-announcing-the-beryl-project): Beryl is a fork of compiz, and a collection of other tools to go along with it. CSM has become Beryl Settings Manager (beryl-settings). CGWD has become Emerald, with its companion emerald-theme-manager.
