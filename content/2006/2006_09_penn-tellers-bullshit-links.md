Featured yesterday on Digg: it seems that there [are a lot of Penn & Teller episodes of 'Bullshit'](http://bullshitlinks.blogspot.com/) on Google Video.  
I had never seen this show before and find it quite funny. Some of the episodes are really hilarious (bottled water, creationism,...). Don't think that the show itself is a great scientific program tho [1], some of the tactics they use to prove their point are based on some psychological characteristics of humans. (E.g.: certain arrangements of groups will perform better than others. E.g.: presenting items in a specific order so that people will most of the times choose the second one due to conditioning from media: first show old boring bad product A, then introducing a better newer product B.) But still: many of the topics they show are indeed: 'bullshit'...  
[1]: Except creationism: that really is complete bullshit.
