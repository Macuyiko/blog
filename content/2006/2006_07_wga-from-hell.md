If you have installed the Windows Genuine Advantage validation checks and are regretting it now (for whatever reason), I have something for you.  
We all know that there are a lot of cracked .dll's around. But you could have run into the following problem while trying to copy/overwrite the files: "Can not delete folder: It is being used by another person or program." or some message like that. Basically, it means that Windows won't let go of the file.  
Booting into safe mode doesn't help, the problem is still there.  
Luckily there are some "Unlocking"-tools which will resolve the problem.  
I have downloaded a nice little package with a batch script which tries to automate the process. [I have completed this](http://www.student.kuleuven.be/%7Es0172696/other/WGAFixer.rar) with the newest .dll-files, and automatic unlocking. Just extract and run execute.cmd. Enjoy.  
Note: there is nothing harmfull in this script, in fact: why not open it in Notepad and check it out for yourself.  
Another note: I have tested this multiple times, but I will not held responsible for any damage done. Running this script is completely up to you. If it doesn't work, you can still unlock and copy-paste the files manually.
