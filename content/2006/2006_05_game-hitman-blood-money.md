Another game up for review.  
I've never actually played any other game from the series, but this one seemed really good so I had to pick it up and try it.  
Story-wise I think the game is great. The atmosphere and locations are really cool. And the assignments you have to fullfill are really original too (GTA for grown-ups if you will).  
**Pros:**  
  - Graphics are nice.
  - Story is cool, nice movies and great objectives.
  - Music is good but nothing special.
**Cons:**
  - You might not like the genre: not enough action maybe?
  - You might not like hitmen...
