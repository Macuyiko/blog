The first public official version of SA: MP (a multiplayer mod for GTA: San Andreas) has been released. Their [website](http://www.sa-mp.com/) is being digged at the moment but you can download it from a [mirror](http://www.sa-mp.net/).
I'm going to post about this a little more later. When there are more servers online.
[MTA](http://www.mtavc.com/), you have been beaten. How long before these guys release their deathmatch client... shouldn't be long now I recon.
