I've playing a bit of W40k-DoW-DC over the past few days. It's still a great game with fast-paced action. It's especially enjoyable when playing quick skirmish or multiplayer battles. ("Okay... one more game.") But the single player campaign is nice too.  
If you've picked up the original and the first expansion, I suggest you definitely buy this one too. It is a stand-alone expansion though: so you can play it without the previous ones...  
I still need to try Company Of Heroes. And I can't wait for Supreme Commander too.
