It seems Sony is taking their advertisement campains seriously, the first European Playstation... oops I mean PLAYSTATION 3 ad hit the internet about yesterday. It seems that Sony doen't worry about the costs: the ad is more than 3 minutes long and more will follow.  
You have to admit it: it's another cool ad. We only get to see some shots from a real game at the end, but it looks good... maybe the PS3 won't do as bad as everyone thinks after all... maybe it will do real good (after the price drop).
