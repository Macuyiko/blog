Remember the colored-balls Bravia ad? [Of course you do](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1986163622081916167&q=bravia).  
It seems their second ad (again: with lots of color) is almost finished. Watch a cool production movie [here](http://www.infectiousvideos.com/index.php?p=showvid&a=playvid&sid=2105&cr=hotplay). And see [more images](http://www.bravia-advert.com/paint/pictures/) on the [Bravia ad site](http://www.bravia-advert.com/).  
Isn't it cool when there is so much advertising about an... ad? Absolutely lovely idea.  
Also, I absolutely crave the "like. no. other." logo at the end, it makes me want to buy Sony products, a lot of them. If only the rootkit-scandal didn't happen.
