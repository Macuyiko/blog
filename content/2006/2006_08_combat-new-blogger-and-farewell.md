A farewell to Windows that is. Which I removed now from my laptop (since I'm so pleased with Ubuntu).Of course I still run Windows on my gaming-slash-desktop machine. Playing a bit of Flatout 2 lately. I tried to download the F.E.A.R. Combat installer (multiplayer component of F.E.A.R. which is now released for free). But after installing and trying to run the game, it quit on me with a nice ugly error... so no Combat for me until I sort this out.
Meanwhile, I've been reading about the new Blogger and their closed beta, which I was not invited to. Until today: I accidently logged in with my Google account name and password and *poof*: it gave me an option to migrate. I picked a new template to try some things (I actually like this one now). The new templating system is quite cool: it is really easy to arrange items and pick fonts and colors.  
I see that there is now an option to set labels too for a post (which is a fancy name for "tags") which means I don't have to use the Technorati ones anymore...  
That was all folks... more later.
