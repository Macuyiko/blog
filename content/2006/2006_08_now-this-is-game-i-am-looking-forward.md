Introversion Software presents its third title, [DEFCON](http://www.everybody-dies.com/), a stunning online multiplayer simulation of global thermonuclear war.  
You play the role of a military Commander hidden deep within an Underground bunker. Your mission - to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst disabling their ability to attack your own. Start by launching your battleships, subs and bombers in order to decimate your opponent's defences. Scramble together your alliances but remember only one can stand victorious.  
Prepare your pre-emptive strike before one of your supposed allies gets the same idea. Choose the perfect moment for betrayal, obliterating your opponents with an apocalyptic thermonuclear barrage, but get it wrong and their devastating counter attack will bring you to your knees!  
That really sounds cool. Remembers us of the movie Wargames of course. Check the [videos](http://www.everybody-dies.com/about/video.html) on their website. Uplink and Darwinia were such great games too, try the demos if you haven't already.
