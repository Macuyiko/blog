A [few days ago](http://bedagainstthewall.blogspot.com/2006/03/cool-flickr-tool.html) I talked about a Flickr background switcher and how it gave me an idea for a little script.  
I present you: the DeviantART leech script. Able to quickly show (and store) the newest additions.  
Why, you might ask. Well, I like Flickr very much, but for my wallpapers, I like the DeviantART 3D wallpapers more. However, it's annoying to check every week for cool backgrounds, click on every one of them, download them, etc... (having more than 30 tabs open in Firefox).  
You can see the script in action [here](http://macuyiko2.freeserverhost.com/deviantleech/). It is set up to only show a few pictures. If you [download the script](http://macuyiko2.freeserverhost.com/deviantleech/deviantartleech.php), you can uncomment some lines in the img.php file, so it will store the pictures on your harddrive locally.  
**Warning:** be advised that using this script puts quite the load on the DeviantART servers. I would strongly advise against setting the script up to download all 8000 1600x1200 wallpapers. If you do, I am of course not responsible at all for any consequences.
