Ah the suspense... Edgy Eft is coming out tomorrow (if all goes well).  
  
Here are the update instructions once more:  1. (Backup.)2. `gksu "update-manager -c -d"` for the masses: quick and easy.3. Or replace `dapper` with `edgy` in `/etc/apt/sources.list` and do a `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`.4. Make sure everything is ok:      sudo apt-get -f install      sudo dpkg --configure -a
Of course, this is all over Digg and others. But I just couldn't help sharing this. It'll be a tense day tomorrow...
