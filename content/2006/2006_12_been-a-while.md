It's been a while, I know, but it's been busy busy busy during the week... And in the weekends I've been playing Neverwinter Nights 2 far too much.  
I have to restate some of my opinions about the game: the story turned out to be quite good. Also: some of the henchmen are marvelous (Sand! Ammon Jerro!) while others are boring in their own RPG way (Cassavir... Qara...).  
I'm chill-replaying the game now with a sorcerer (quick casting rules). Then: I'll try to toy around a bit with the toolset.  
More later...
