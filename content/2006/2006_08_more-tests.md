On those boring evenings I like doing Internet tests just for fun (see previous postings).   
A few days ago I did some Mindviz tests...
This one is quite true:  
> **I'm 45.0% nerdy!**  > My computer appears to be my best friend!  
And I'm kinda proud of this one ;):  
> **I have an IQ of 156!**  > I am in the 99th percentile!  > This means that I did better than 99 percent of the people who have taken this test!  > The average score for this test is 100.  > The maximum score is 167.  > The minimum score is 66.  
Also proud about this one:  > **I'm 47.7% lazy!**  > I may want to consider removing that youatloaf from my shirt  
Not so proud...  
> **I'm 48.0% pure!**  > I'm on my way to a healthy existence, keep up the good work!  
No news here:  
> **I'm 50.0% freaky!**  > Wow calm down, I'm starting to freak you out!
