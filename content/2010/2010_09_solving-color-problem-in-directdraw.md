Title: Solving Color Problem In DirectDraw Games Update

I've received a few more e-mails and blog comments containing input and information about the famous DirectDraw palette problem which messes up colors in older games.  

In particular, Windows contains [compatibility entries in the registry](http://go.hopx.net/2010/05/256-color-issues-with-directdraw-and.html), andÂ [Jari Komppa](http://sol.gfxile.net/ddhack/) has written a ddraw.dll which wraps DirectDraw.  

I've updated [my blog post from 2009 once more](|filename|/2009/2009_07_solving-color-problem-red-grass-purple.md) to reflect this new information. Currently, the easiest way to run Age Of Empires 2: The Conquerors without any hassles still seems to be my tool, which you can find [there](|filename|/2009/2009_07_solving-color-problem-red-grass-purple.md) as well.  

P.S.: Also, I will be competing in the [Google A.I. Challenge](http://www.ai-contest.com/) again this year. I look forward to seeing you there!
