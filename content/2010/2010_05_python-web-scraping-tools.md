Just a note for myself, a list of interesting Python tools for my next web scraping project:

  - [urllib2](http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html):Â extensible library for opening URLs.

  - [PyQuery](http://pyquery.org/): jQuery-like traversing and selecting for Python.

  - [mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/): stateful programmatic web browsing in Python.

  - [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/): not supported/maintained that much anymore. Latest versions are rather slow and buggy.

  - [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/): looks nice, includes the URL requesting part as well, with cookie support and such.

  - [lxml.html](http://codespeak.net/lxml/lxmlhtml.html):Â lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.

Probably going with Scrapy.
