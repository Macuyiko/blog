I've made some small tweaks to this blog:

* Social widget added with latest Twitter status, and link to Friendfeed account. Completely clientsided with Javascript. Using [twitter.js](http://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/).
* Was getting bored of the black theme, so I made a white one, made two css files and added a switcher -- using [this code](http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~bertucci/csci245/styleswitcher.htm). (You should be able to see it at the right-top of the page.)

Your choice is saved in a cookie and also Javascript-based (no other choice with Blogger).

The Bidvertiser ads still have a black background in the white theme, I'll look at that later (I might remove them anyway).
