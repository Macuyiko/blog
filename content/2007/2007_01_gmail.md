Title: Gmail

What's up with Google the last few days? First, a glitch was reported about users getting [their mails deleted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/28/gmail-disaster-reports-of-mass-email-deletions/). This glitch is now (luckily) fixed.

Then that hack about your contact list getting stolen, try logging into Gmail and go to one of the following links:

[http://docs.google.com/data/contacts?out=js&show=ALL&psort=Affinity&callback=google&max=99999](http://docs.google.com/data/contacts?out=js&show=ALL&psort=Affinity&callback=google&max=99999)

[http://video.google.com/data/contacts?out=js&max=500&psort=Affinity&callback=getContacts](http://video.google.com/data/contacts?out=js&max=500&psort=Affinity&callback=getContacts)

All your contacts in JSON format! Accessible to any website which uses this as a src in a script-tag.

Solutions? Referrer-checking (not that good: can be spoofed). Better: using unique keys in each request. They probably used a combination of solutions.

It seems to be already fixed now, the only thing it returns for me now is:

    google ({ Success: false, Errors: []})

But the XML output is still accessible though: [http://docs.google.com/data/contacts?out=xml&show=ALL&psort=Affinity&callback=google&max=999999](http://docs.google.com/data/contacts?out=xml&show=ALL&psort=Affinity&callback=google&max=999999).

I tried hacking up a little piece of code, but alas: loading the XML into the frame and then trying to do a frames['the_frame'].document.getElementsByTagName('Email'); does not work. Both Firefox and IE prevent stealing content from frames across domains.

Maybe we should use XMLHTTPRequest, then? Also doesn't work in Firefox, even when trying to netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserRead"); it will fail. Internet Explorer (tested in 7) will complain about ActiveX objects being used.

So is this still a security issue? I would say no. Locally (trusted zone): Firefox doesn't allow the described actions, and IE at least warns the user. When surfing on the Internet (untrusted zone): the objects were blocked by default (my IE and Firefox were set up in such a way that when I tried to run this script from the web: they would block the cross-domain XMLHTTPRequest by default without asking). Maybe IE6 is a bit more insecure.

For the people who want to try it out: example [html here](http://student.kuleuven.be/~s0172696/src/gmailsrc.html) (use IE, allow Blocked ActiveX content for it to work).

Another sad message: [Gmail's storage has stopped increasing](http://digg.com/tech_news/Gmail_s_Storage_Capacity_Stops_Increasing)... Mine has also stopped at 2800MB... Why?

There is a little bit of good news too: the calculator [works again](http://www.google.com/search?q=2%2B2&lr=)...
