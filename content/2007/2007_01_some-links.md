Via [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/): find out [the sex of your brain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/index_cookie.shtml). I'm a perfect average male. Also: take a look at these [10 kick ass opening sequences](http://www.laboratory101.com/?p=38).  
Another fun test: the [super hero](http://www.thesuperheroquiz.com/) and [super villain](http://www.thesuperheroquiz.com/villain) test. I'm Dr. Doom. (Blessed with smarts and power but burdened by vanity.) And Green Lantarn. (Hot-headed. You have strong will power and a good imagination.)
