This game took me a little longer to finish: two days.  
The game itself is actually pretty good but not that special. I had expected a bit more from it: being more evil for example.  
Pros:  
  - Nice story.
  - Minions.
  - Graphics are decent.
  - Sound is nice.
  - Maps and environments are awesome.
  - Will remind you of Dungeon Keeper (and Fable too).  
Cons:  
  - Not evil enough.
  - Very, very linear. No replay value, apart from the different endings (which you can watch anyway by installing RADTools).  
  - Could do with a bit more spells.
  - Just needs more tweaking, Overlord 2 could be something really worth your while tho, so why not pick up this one?
