I continue -- I'm in a posting mood.

[JDarkRoom](http://www.codealchemists.com/jdarkroom/) \- simple text editor: written in Java, full screen (!), and you can choose colours. Strange stuff, but it is actually cool to use.

Pictures of [illegal brands](http://bizarrearea.com/2007/01/17/illegal-brands/). Quite funny.

[Table of equivalents](http://foolks.blogspot.com/2007/01/tables-of-equivalents.html). A huge (very huge) list of open source software alternatives. Even had names I didn't now about before. Be sure to check it out.

[Pirates of Silicon Valley](http://viralvids.web-log.nl/viralvids/2007/01/pirates_of_sili.html) \- see the full documentary online. If you want to know what the Apple vs. Microsoft battle was all about, then don't miss it. Also: I was surprised to see that Steve was such a douche. Bill looked much more charismatic, also towards his company (but still stole a GUI).

Interesting [article about conciousness](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394-1,00.html).

[13 things I wish I learned in college](http://www.nextstudent.com/nextpath/nextpath-online/13-things-i-wish-i-learned-in-college.asp). Nice post.
