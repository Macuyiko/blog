I've been looking for a way to do this for some time now: scrolling unfocused windows, in Windows. You can do it with a Mac ([movie here](http://macromates.com/movies/move_inactive_window.mov)) and on Linux. I became accustomed to it after prolonged Ubuntu-use on my laptop. (It's incredibly handy on lower resolutions too.)  
So I posted a [note (with replies) on Pownce](http://www.pownce.com/Macuyiko/notes/484571/)...  
So I'm using [KatMouse](http://www.code-scout.net/katmouse/) now. Program is working perfectly fine, and was exactly what I had in mind.  
Also: I'm beginning to like Pownce (much more than Twitter anyway).
