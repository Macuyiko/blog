Another quick review for this one. Not much to say about this game, I mean: it's Settlers. It's back, and it's 3d and cuter than ever :).  
Pros:  
  - Settler's back!
  - Game looks very nice.
  - Long and entertaining missions.
  - Happy atmosphere.
Cons:  
  - Few bugs still around.
  - Needs quite a bit of system resources.
