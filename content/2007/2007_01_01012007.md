That means happy new year everyone!

Had a great party last night and a hangover now? Check out [The 86 Rules of Boozing](http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/issues/01-02/01_02_booze_rules.htm). Here're some higlights:

> 9\. Get the bartender's attention with eye contact and a smile.
>
> 22\. Never talk to someone in the restroom unless you're doing the same thing--urinating, waiting in line or washing your hands.
>
> 24\. After your sixth drink, do not look at yourself in the mirror. It will shake your confidence.
>
> 35\. Learn to appreciate hangovers. If it was all good times every jackass would be doing it.
>
> 39\. Never tip with coins that have touched you. If your change is $1.50, you can tell the barmaid to keep the change, but once she has handed it to you, you cannot give it back. To a bartender or cocktail waitress, small change has no value.
>
> 43\. A bar is a college, not a nursery. If you spill a beer, clean it up. If you break a glass, wait for a staff member to clean it up, then blame it on someone else.
>
> 54\. Never lie in a bar. You may, however, grossly exaggerate and lean.
>
> 65\. Before you die, single-handedly make one decent martini.
>
> 69\. If there is ever any confusion, the fuller beer is yours.
>
> 80\. Anyone with three or more drinks in his hands has the right of way.

I wish you all the best for 2007!
