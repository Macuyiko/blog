So I picked up Jade Empire for the PC a few days ago. I was astonished because I didn't even know it was released for the PC. (I've been jealous of console owners who could play the game and then I even miss the PC release!)  
So after I quick install I was ready to go. I was more than happy to experience a new Bioware-experience. As coincidence would have it, I had been playing a few Neverwinter Nights premium modules the days before just because I wanted a Bioware experience. (And no, KotOR 2 and NWN 2 just aren't the same.)  
And the game didn't disappoint. I you haven't played it yet: you should. The whole story was fantastic. The characters were well though out, and the combat was fun without being frustrating (I didn't die a single time on the easiest difficulty level).  
If you are a hardcore PC RPG gamer you will notice that this game is a tad linear. Of course there are quite a lot of side quests but you can't roam very freely. This seems to be a typical characteristic of more 'modern' RPGs, like Fable, or even Overlord. On the other hand, this also has pros: at least you don't get lost or distracted. Also: Fable could learn a few things from Jade Empire, this is how a console RPG should be done: it's all about the story and the atmosphere. The game is fun, quick to pick up and you don't have to manage your inventory and character every two steps while still keeping enough numbers, statistics and options for you to look at.  
I think I'm going to rest for a bit now after this marathon-gaming-session. But I think I'm going to replay the game with another character later.  
Let's hope that [Mass Effect](http://masseffect.bioware.com/) [comes to](http://kotaku.com/gaming/pc/rumor-mass-effect-coming-to-pc-209258.php) [the PC](http://www.johng.co.uk/2006/10/21/breaking-news-mass-effect-coming-to-pc-in-2007/) [as well](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/10/22/mass-effect-rumored-for-the-pc/).
