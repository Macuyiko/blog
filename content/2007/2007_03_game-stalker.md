Played a bit of Stalker yesterday. It's a nice first-person shooter but has some issues (don't try playing it on Vista, neither did I).  
Good:  
  - Atmospheric: great graphics, huge maps, great architecture and maps!
  - Immersive, open-ended... it seems there are 7 different endings.
  - Survival - you get attacked by wild dogs.
  - Horror!
  - Lots to explore. Again: mapdesign is great!  
  - Lots of different factions.  
Bad:  
  - Inventory system could be smoother.
  - Story could be clearer.
  - High system reqs.
Ugly:  
  - Bugs!
  - Late release.
  - Don't use Vista.
