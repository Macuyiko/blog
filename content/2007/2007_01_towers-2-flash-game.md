Very addictive game! Check out [Towers 2](http://novelconcepts.co.uk/FlashElementTD/). I couldn't stop playing for days! It's based upon Warcraft III. You build various kinds of towers to stop the monsters from invading. Give it a try. Now that Flash 9 final is out for Linux, nothing should stop you ;).
