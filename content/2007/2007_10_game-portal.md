Man, what a surprise this game was!  
This is a great puzzle game, which you should also play multiple times (once with the commentaries).  
You're a woman who wakes up in a cell inside a lab and presented with a portal that lets you walk out of the room and into another. With this gun you must solve lots of puzzles which get gradually harder.  
Along the way, GlaDOS, an AI with a computerized female voice, guides you. GlaDOS is incredibly funny, and gets even funnier at the end. The whole game is actually hilarious, in a good way! The scripts and characters are wonderfully designed. The game is minimalistic in nature and all these little extras are just the topping of the... cake.  
GlaDOS will lie to you, cute turrets who'll say "Where are you?" everytime you go into hiding, an amazing weighted companion cube, and cake. This game is full of little surprises. You just have to play it and experience its awesomeness!

Pros:    - FPS puzzle game, with portals!
  - Great ending song.
  - Hilarious humor.
  - Unforgettable characters.
  - Minimalistic and focused nature, without ever becoming boring.
  - Where's my sequel?
Cons:  
  - A tad short.
Now only Company Of Heroes: Opposing Fronts and Quake Wars remain on my list of games-to-play. But that's for later.
