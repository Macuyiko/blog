I've just finished all the campaigns of Command And Conquer 3. I must say I am pretty impressed.  
I also played a bit of Supreme Commander but I didn't really like that game and I've already uninstalled it.  
Supreme Commander is good because:  
  - Huge maps.
  - Cool units.
  - Strategic zoom is really helpful.
  - Multiplayer.
  - 
But bad because:
  - Boring maps.
  - Though you can build hundreds of units, they are all so tiny...
  - Repetitive missions... always the same.
Command And Conquer has:
  - Kane!
  - Kane! (Yes, he counts for two points!)
  - Full-motion video is back and you can't help but love the cheesy acting.
  - Nice detailed maps.
  - A superb engine. The maps load incredibly fast, and there is no huge framerate drop - ever! Even with a lot of units on screen... how do they do it? (Supreme Commander takes ages to load.)
  - Cool units.
  - Fun multiplayer.
  - Did I mention Kane?
  - Spectacular effects.
It does need better patching though (especially for people without high-end systems). On my system however the game ran like a dream in 1600x1200 with all options on highest (except AA, which is level 1).
However, if you adored Total Annihilation, you will like Supreme Commander. If you loved C&C, you'll love Tiberium Wars. I liked both, but I do prefer to play a game of CC3.
