Title: The Number

The Internet is going crazy about some random number (and it's not 23).

Apparently, typing out an hexadecimal value will get you killed / deleted / censored / jailed / destroyed / ignored / access to HD-DVD content. It goes something like: `09 F9 11 02`. But it also has `9D 74 E3 5B` in it. Maybe `D8 41 56` somewhere too. `C5 63 56` may or may not have something to do with it. I will give away that it ends with `88 C0` tho.

Anyway, Digg is going nuts. Moderators are constantly deleting any article about this number. They are even deleting irrelevant posts to cover up their censoring tracks. However, they seem to forget that this is the Internet.

Let's see how this ends. I wonder how Rose will talk his way out of this.
