Wow.  
Half Life blew me away, again. I finished the game in one big long marathon session. Twice. The second time with the developers' commentary enabled -- which I still love.  
I'm not going to spoil anything, but I found the ending completely unexpected and fantastic. Also, Merle Dandridge's voice acting (Alyx) was incredible. When the credits rolled over my screen I just wanted to play Ep. 3 immediately. The game itself was great, with the return of old friends, and the introduction of new friends -- and new enemies.  
Just like episode 1, the game provides you with a companion (either Alyx or a Vortigaunt) most of the time.  
Maybe I'll play Half Life 2, Ep. 1 and Ep. 2 in one big sitting soon...  
Pros:  
  - Story is great!
  - Characters to love.
  - Great voice acting.
  - Graphics are enhanced and still look amazing.
  - Cinematic physics - so cool.
  - Longer than the first episode.
  - Great sound track.
Cons:  
  - Err, none?
  - Okay, maybe still too short ;).
  - Also: no new real weapons, I would love to handle a sniper myself (instead of the crossbow).
  - You might lose some sleep.
