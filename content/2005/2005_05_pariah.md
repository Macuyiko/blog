I've been really busy lately, so I'm really happy it's weekend (still a lot of work to do but oh well). I'm installing Pariah right now (cd1, cd2, cd3, cd1 again, cd3, done) and starting up...  
Let's see if this plays away.  
P.S.: going to update my system to AMD 64 bit (or Xeon) (two CPU's actually!), and a X850PT graphics card soon, should run like a dream then.
