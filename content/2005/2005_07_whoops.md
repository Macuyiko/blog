Oh God! Custom badly written img tags messing up the template aaaaah!  
It's fixed now.  
Too bad I had to resize the Sloganizer banner... Oh well.  
Since I was on a Microsoft-rant in my previous post, I'm currently downloading the latest Lonhorn built (checks) 5048. Just to look if it's any nicer (and runs better than the previous built in VMware).  
I will keep you updated.
