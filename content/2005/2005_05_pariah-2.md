I just died... stumbled of a platform and into the lava we go... But the game is quite nice, graphics are cool, gameplay is quick. Gore and blood level is nice too, I'll fiddle around with the map editor if I've some spare time.  
Reminds me that I'm still waiting for The Bards Tale to come out on pc, I still have to install Dungeon Lords too...
