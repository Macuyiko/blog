When browsing the internet or while working I always have something playing trough my headphones. Fact is that sometimes music just can't satisfy me, I want to hear people...  
So I've been listening to all the Gamespot [live](http://www.gamespot.com/gslive/) videos whole day long (even while gaming), why those movies? I like the subject, and it's nice to have people around you who keep talking about Japanese console games on and on.  
Speaking of gaming, I can't decide between PSP or X360. They both seem nice. X360 has bigger screen/better looking games. But the PSP is portable/has more functionality...  
We'll see.
