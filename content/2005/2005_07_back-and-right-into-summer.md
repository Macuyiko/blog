Finally, exams have ended. Still, I had a lot of things to do before finally starting normal life again: cleaning stuff in the house as well on the computer, install latest drivers, check all the webcomics I'd missed, etc...  
After all this I was finally able to start playing GTA: San Andreas. I've finished all the missions by now, and I must say, the game is great! It gave me the same feeling as when I ended Vice City: 'I want more!'
First of all: the map is huge. There are a lot of areas to travel to and explore. The graphics have improved, too. The engine, however -- which was also used in GTA 3 (Liberty City) and GTA: Vice City -- has seen its best days. I can't wait for the next GTA which will take place in London, 60ties, if we may believe the rumors.  
There is also a GTA coming out for the PSP, which I will buy together with Lumines, Wipeout, and a PSP, of course, which will be released in Europe in September... (Firmware 1.50 is hacked by the way, search for Swaploit, or even better, KXploit.)  
I have a lot of other things to do (installing Battlefield 2 for example), I will post more and detailed when I have more time.
