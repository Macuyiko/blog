Playing games of course! I've finished Quake 4 recently (which was done really fast, since I used cheats).
Before going insane and 'you ***ing loser'-like, please let me explain why I used cheats.  
The game is boring... there. Of course it's a nice game if you want to blast a few grunts real quick, but still I think that Quake 1 was much more entertaining (by the way: in Quake 1 all the doors could open, in Q4 most of them are "locked").  
Of course the graphics are all bumpy and crispy and whatnot, fighting against two enemies at once which will vanish after two seconds after dying was never so much fun. Not.  
And thus I've spent the last two days on completing Call of Duty 2, which was much more entertaining! The absence of a physics engine (and a health bar) is a good thing. I only have one remark though:  
* Direct X9: 1024 x 768 everything on high and running quite smooth (except D-Day was a bit jumpy).  * Direct X7: 1600 x 1200 (!), also everything on high and running ultrasmooth, you don't see shadows on clothes and such, but I think DX7 still looks good enough, so I'm playing Singleplayer with 9, and multi with 7.  
You know, graphics aren't everything, if you must choose between CoD 2, F.E.A.R. or Q4, take CoD 2, and if you haven't played the first one plus expansion, pick them up too, both are as chaotic and compelling as the second one. The first ones also have more stealthier missions and more indoor environments (which I don't like so much, so I prefer CoD 2).  
One negative remark though: still no German/Japanese/Italian campaign, why not? It would give some interesting new stories and settings... Oh well, maybe for the expansion pack.  
I've also been playing Civ 4 a little... I'm still too dumb to fully understand it, but I quite like it.  
P.S.: again a game rant, I have to start talking about something else. Next time.
