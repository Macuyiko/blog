A few days ago I was digging in the gigantic archive of old floppy disks in the house, between which I found a really old game I used to play on my 386 when I was younger, and oh how fast did it run when we got that 486dx.
The game itself is a Boulderdash clone and is called Supaplex. Of course, I couldn't be bothered to install the game, since I do not have a 5Â¼ inch drive in my PC anymore (who does?), and I do have Windows XP, which is extremely stubborn when it comes to playing old DOS games.  
So I just queried the name on Google, and it came up with a lot of results. Of course, there are a lot of other and newer and better looking Boulderdash clones around, but the first result was immediately on the spot: download it [here](http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/dlinst.html#c_install), the game is still being maintained and updated so that even Windows XP users can play it.  
An even better choice to download is [Megaplex](http://www.matemaster.de/mpx/download.html), which runs in a window, which plays sound! (Still no music though, which is not bad, because the music was terrible annoying.)  
Controls are easy: arrow keys to move, press space with an arrow key to 'grab without moving' (try it), and hold space a long time to use a red disk (if you have any), which will explode, so get away quickly.  
If you can't be bothered to do all that, you can go play a nice simple but challenging [Planarity Flash Game](http://home.cwru.edu/~jnt5/Planarity/).
