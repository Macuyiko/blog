Title: First Point

We're back on track, well, sort of.
I've been revisiting some of my projects and have (finally) a new structure.
This blog will become "Âµacuyiko's Mindcube", an English blog about my life, thoughts, code, etc... Why "Mindcube"? A Mindcube is a cube in which you put your thoughts.
Mindpoint would have not enough dimensions, Mindline would be too linear, Mindsquare is already too often used. Mindcube is already used as well, so it's not my trademark.
Maybe I change it later to Mindhypercube or Mindwhatacubewouldbeiftherewerereallyelevendimensions.
I already have another blog, a Dutch one. It's not live yet and I will not post a link when it is.
I had plans for an online magazine, also Dutch, but that'll have to wait a bit.
All these (and other side-) projects are supervised by the Muzeron "brand".
This blog is available at [www.macuyiko.tk](http://www.macuyiko.tk), the Muzeron main page at [www.muzeron.tk](http://www.muzeron.tk).
So far for the boring post. More interesting stuff coming later...
