MSN [Virtual Earth](http://virtualearth.msn.com/) has gone live today.  
It seems that this is basically a complete ripoff of Google Maps... Sigh. Oh well, what'd you expect? So, Google Maps or MSN VE, what'll it be? 

Speaking of Google [Earth](http://earth.google.com), why not try Google [Moon](http://moon.google.com), or the [Hybrid](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.036764,-118.273680&spn=0.013176,0.021329&amp;amp;z=1&t=h&hl=en) interface of Google Maps, which is rumored to use transparent .pngs, but since when can Internet Explorer render transparent png images?
