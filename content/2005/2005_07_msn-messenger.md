For all you people who are using MSN Messenger and wanting to try the latest (7.5) beta out: here is a [nice list of mirrors](http://msnmessenger7.net/).  
Be sure to download the 0160 build, so you can apply the Messpatch, it's on [Mess.be](http://www.mess.be) (browse around the site to find it, Mess does not permit hotlinking), so you can remove all the unwanted garbage.  
And why does Microsoft keep putting their shortcuts, homepage, toolbars, and other stupid crap in their Messenger installer file, making it unnecessary large, and why does it enable all those 'helpful options' by default so I must uncheck those boxes every time I install? Ugh.
