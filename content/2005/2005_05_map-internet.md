I've downloaded the [DIMES](http://www.netdimes.org/) Agent yesterday, and I must say I really don't know what it's purpose is. Slashdot says that it's able to generate nice looking graphs (see [here](http://www.netdimes.org/asmap.png) and especially [here](http://www.netdimes.org/ipmap.png)), and also on my computer it was able to generate fairly good looking lines, dots, and numbers.  
If you're into resource wasters, other cpu cycle killers you can try are: [SETI](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) @ Home (find E.T.), [World Community Grid](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/) (battle cancer), and many [others](http://www.grid.org).
