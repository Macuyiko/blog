I just saw Star Wars III, and I must say that it's pretty good, but it's not anything really special. The dark tone of the movie is nicely worked out, but the acting and story could've been a little better.  
I you would like to take a peek in the mind of a Sith Lord, you can still check out [The Darth Side](http://darthside.blogspot.com/), an extremely well-written blog about the daily happenings in the live of Darth Vader. It's a must-read. A pity that the author has stopped the story already though. (I first thought this was some marketing campaign from Lucasarts, but that doesn't seem to be the case.)
