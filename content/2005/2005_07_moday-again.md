It's been a while since my last post.  
I've been watching stuff, mainly. First The Hitchhikers' Guide To The Galaxy, which was quite nice. Of course it is extremely difficult to make a movie out of Adams' books without embarrassing yourself, but they sure have tried, and actually made quite a good movie out of it. Actually, I hope they make a sequel (they still have enough books left). And since I watched it, I've been feeling an uncontrollable urge to wear a towel...  
Second: Invader Zim complete. Yes it's the famous, spread over-the-whole-internet-cartoon, something everyone who calls himself an internet geek should've watched. I've laughed a few times, especially with the amazing Gir, and Ms. Bitters who reminds me of an old teacher I once had.  
In China they are currently struggling to find a new title for Hаrrу Роttеr аnd thе _Hаlf-Вlооd Рrincе_, since Half-Blood can't be translated to Chinese without breaking the meaning (half-blood equals half-human equals half-beast there), they may chose another title.
