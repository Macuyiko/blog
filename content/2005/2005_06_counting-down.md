They're back; of course they are back. They had said before that their shutdown was only rumored. It was a nice joke to give them some spare time for preparing the launch of version 2 of their tracker and website (which is really impressive now). In about 10 languages (Dutch too), and more torrents than ever before. Means that we can download all the Linux distros again ;).  
I'm going to test out the Hypercube tracker out soon too. There are a lot of other projects waiting too! A new site, finalizing my webradio thoughts, an online game, an online OS (name SnOS, more information about that later), and playing a lot of games.  
The problem at the moment? Exams, I've already talked about them and in a few days they finally start. When I'm done with that it's off to university!  
So I'll see you in a few weeks (no computer use during exams, it's for my own good)! I'll miss the Internet, but coming back always gives a new, fresh feeling to the whole scene so I guess that's a silver lining...
