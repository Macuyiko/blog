Hello everyone, I'm checking some E3 videos out from [SW: Empire at War](http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swempireatwar/indexFlash.html), the game looks pretty cool. I'm also waiting for Black and White 2, Age of Empires 3, and my PSP.  
That's right, PSP has won the battle, it will be a PSP and not a X360. But the PS3 has my interest too!  
However, buying all this stuff does cost money. So I'd appreciate it if you give to top Google banner a little single click - thanks!  
Enough whining now. [Systm](http://systm.org/) is the new show from the creators of [thebroken](www.thebroken.org). thebroken was quite good, but still a bit beginner-like. I'm going to check it out now and we'll see what is has to offer, expect comments...
