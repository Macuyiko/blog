I'm watching the Star Wars full trailer on loop right now,... I think I'm going to watch it until the movie comes out (after that I'll just loopwatch the movie, of course).While waiting, you can always built your [own](http://www.padawansguide.com/lightsabers.shtml) lightsaber or [learn](http://www.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber.htm) how it works...
