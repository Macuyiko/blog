Because I was bored and my memory is having problems remembering things lately, I've put together a list for me with all the games I should keep an eye on. Please only read this if you're interested in my gaming needs, otherwise just ignore ;).  
* *Call of Duty 2*: it should be clear why, looks stunning and story will be immense again, too!* *Brothers in Arms 2*: maybe...* *Bet on Soldier*: again maybe, if I'm bored at the time of release.* *F.E.A.R.*: graphics looks amaaaazing!* *Half Life 2 Aftermath*: just one to have to complete the collection.* *Quake 4*: grew up with Quake 1, so... (Actually, that's a lie, I grew up with Jill of the Jungle and later Duke Nukem. That's Duke Nukem 1, mind you.)* *Unreal Tournament 2007*: woot, more killin'.* *Star Wars Battlefront 2*: maybe.* *Commandos Strike Force*: maybe.* *Hellgate London*: this is a weird one, could be interesting.* *Prince of Persia 3*: definitely!* *Battlestations Midway*: could be fun.* *Star Wars Empire at War*: must... Have... This! This is what Force commander should've been!* *Age of Empires 3*: also really necessary.* *Paraworld*: looks nice.* *Outfront 2*: the sequel to the extremely hard Soldiers, which I loved!
* *Fable*: yes yes yes yes yes! A must-have in my opinion.
* *The Elder Scrolls 4*: yes, that's Oblivion, 'nuff said.
* *Dungeon Siege 2*: oh well, make it quick.
* *X3 Reunion*: I hope this one will be better, because I still love space games.
* *Black and White 2*: yup, also a must-have.
* *Spore*: now this is a weird game, I must definitely try this one out. 
This nice long list really fills the page. Of course I could make this list go on and on and on... you get the point.
