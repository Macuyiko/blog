It seems that after all these months, Blogger has grown a lot... I like it very much, and I liked it even more after I found out that my username was still stored in the system.  
So maybe I'll get used to blogging after all, and I will do some 'blogsperiments' now. Instead of updating the main site ([www.muzeron.tk](http://www.muzeron.tk), if it still lives), I will post some stuff here, if everything goes well, we could continue this...
