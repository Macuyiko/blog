In the same spirit as [last year](http://blog.macuyiko.com/2012/02/games-ill-keep-eye-on-in-2012.html), this is a (preliminary) list of game I'm interested in, releasing in 2013.  
First of all, let's revisit 2012... Here are the games I was interested in last year, together with the outcome -- at least according to me:  
  - Star Wars: The Old Republic: skipped it
  - Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning: it was okay, but nothing special
  - Binary Domain: let-down
  - SSX: okay, not great
  - Syndicate: let-down
  - Jak and Daxter Collection: great nostalgia trip
  - The Darkness 2: actually quite an awesome game
  - I am Alive: didn't buy it
  - Mass Effect 3: the one which disconnected me from the series (and I was a huge fan). I've heard there's some great DLC, but I've yet to play it
  - Diablo III: okay, but not as I expected
  - Devil May Cry HD Collection: have yet to buy it
  - Silent Hill HD Collection: have yet to buy it
  - Prey 2: didn't release
  - Starhawk: meh
  - Far Cry 3: awesome! In my 2012 top five list  - Max Payne 3: a great game, but alas missed by many top 2012 lists  - Darksiders II: greatly enjoyed it  - Prototype 2: okay, but quickly forgotten compared to the other open-world games of 2012  - Tomb Raider: didn't release  - Guild Wars 2: best MMORPG of the moment  - Borderlands 2: not bad, but got a bit of a "more of the same"-feeling here  - The Last Guardian: didn't release  - Lollipop Chainsaw: fun, but not spectacular  - Grand Theft Auto V: didn't release  - BioShock Infinite: didn't release  - Doom 4: didn't release  - Journey: again an awesome game, top listed  - XCOM: Enemy Unknown: another great title and a must-play  - Monaco: fun indie game  - The Witness: did this release?  - Firefall: still waiting  - Cube World: didn't release  - Overgrowth: did this release?  - Path of Exile: couldn't hype me  - Grim Dawn: didn't release  - Starfarer: did this release?  - Legend of Grimrock: a great indie title but alas flew a bit under the radar  - Torchlight II: gave me more hours of fun than Diablo III did  - Survivors of Ragnarok: did this release?  - Project Zomboid: did this release? I should check up on this one  - Masters of the Broken World: did this release?  - Warlock: Master of the Arcane: did this release?  - A Game of Dwarves: let-down  - Jagged Alliance: let-down  - Castle Story: didn't release  - Retro City Rampage: actually pretty fun
