Subtitle: Most of these are indie titles, again

2016 turned out to be a great year for gaming, with Dishonored 2, The Witness, Doom, Overwatch, Superhot, Thumper, Hyper Light Drifter, Cogmind, Devil Daggers, Furi, Brigador, Age of Empires 2 HD keeping me entertained throughout most of the year. 

Which games am I looking forward to in 2017? Below follows my personal list.

* Big budget titles: [**Prey**](https://prey.bethesda.net/) and [**Red Dead Redemption 2**](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/), of course, as well as [**Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of war III**](https://www.dawnofwar.com/).
* I might give [Tales of Berseria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/429660/) as spin, though I'm not normally one for JRPG's.
* [**Yooka-Laylee**](http://www.playtonicgames.com/games/yooka-laylee/): hope this one will be a lot of childlike fun.
* [**The Church In The Darkness**](http://www.paranoidproductions.com/church/) looks interesting thanks to its procedurally-generated cult story.
* Described as a love child between GTA I and Syndicate Wars, [**Tokyo 42**](http://www.tokyo42.com/) certainly looks interesting.
* [**Thimbleweed Park**](https://blog.thimbleweedpark.com/) might be one of the adventure games I try this year, thanks to Ron Gilbert being at the helm and Mark Ferrari doing the visuals. Mark has a [great talk about 8bit art that you absolutely should watch right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRwHpU_kcPE)!
* [**Frozen Synapse 2**](http://www.frozensynapse2.com/); I was a fan of the original so this will be worth checking out.
* [**Constructor HD**](http://www.system3.com/games/constructor-hd/), as I'm a sucker for nostalgia-meets-HD releases.

* [**Kingdoms and Castles**](https://www.fig.co/campaigns/kingdoms-and-castles?media_id=382#updates), mainly since its art direction is positively adorable.

* [**Tower 57**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/514621648/tower-57) is a twin stick shooter with 16-bit inspired pixel art, destructible environments, and a heavy focus on co-op.
* [**Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/501590/): not sure yet about this one, since I already own the original and don't think it's fair having to rebuy it. Also I'm not that much of a Gearbox fan anymore lately.
* [**Strafe**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/442780/) and [**Dusk**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/): two beautiful oldskool gory Quake-like shooters.

* [**Eitr**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/350050/): an action RPG with exceptional combat.
* [**RIOT - Civil Unrest**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/342310/) has been on my list for a few years now but it might finally see a release this year.
* [**Manifold Garden**](http://manifold.garden/): also an ealier-seen entry, (formerly known as Relativity.)
* [**Drift Stage**](http://www.driftstagegame.com/): also an older entry. Still not sure about the release date but still like the art style. [**Wings of Saint Nazaire**](http://www.wingsofstnazaire.com/) is also still on the list, as is [**Irkalla**](http://www.irkallagame.com/mockups.html) and [**Before**](http://www.beforegame.net/) (which finally got a trailer up).

Fun facts:

* [Earlier I wrote](/post/2015/some-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2015.html) about Mirror's Edge 2 as something I was looking forward to without "having high hopes"... well that turned out to be right.
* In a similar vein, I wrote about No Man's Sky: "of course I am including it in this list. Of course I'm worried about it like everyone else." Well that certainly turned out to be a distaster.
